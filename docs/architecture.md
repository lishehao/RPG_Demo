# RPG_Demo Story Runtime Architecture (v3)

This document defines the current “north star” architecture for an **8–12 minute** interactive narrative RPG runtime.

## 1. Goals

### Product goals
- **8–12 minutes per playthrough** (target **14–16 steps**).
- Provider policy:
  - `openai`: quality-first failfast for route/narration failures.
- **Multiple NPCs**: 3–5 NPCs per story; each appears at least twice.

### Engineering goals
- **Deterministic state transitions** (LLM does not decide success/failure or next node).
- **Schema-first** story format with **lint + regenerate** loops for one-click generation.
- Runtime safety: no dead-ends, no infinite reroute loops, no “invalid input” stalls.

## 2. Core Model: Beat → Scene → Move → Outcome

### 2.1 Beat (macro structure)
**Purpose:** stabilize one-click generation and control pacing.

**Fields (conceptual):**
- `beat_id`, `title`
- `step_budget` (typically 3–4 steps)
- `required_events[]` (tags that must occur in this beat)
- `npc_quota` (min appearances / key interactions per NPC)
- `entry_scene_id`

**Constraints:**
- 3–5 beats total.
- Sum of beat `step_budget` ≈ 14–16 steps.

---

### 2.2 Scene (micro node)
**Purpose:** the player is “in” a scene; scenes form the playable graph.

**Fields (conceptual):**
- `scene_id`, `beat_id`
- `scene_seed` (short: situation + objective + conflict hook; not long prose)
- `present_npcs[]` (typically 1–2 primary NPCs in-scene)
- `enabled_moves[]` (3–5 visible moves; **never > 6**)
- `always_available_moves[]` (2–3 global moves; see below)
- `exit_conditions` (usually based on progress/event tags)

**Constraints:**
- Branching must **reconverge within 1–2 scenes** to prevent content explosion.
- Every scene must include **2–3 global moves** so the player can always proceed.

---

### 2.3 Move (action interface)
**Purpose:** the unit of intent and execution. **Moves are the executable interface**, not “choices”.

Moves are **parameterizable** and reusable across stories.

**Fields (conceptual):**
- `move_id`, `label`
- `intents/synonyms[]` (free-text routing surface)
- `args_schema` (optional; e.g., `target_npc_id`, `tone`, `goal_tag`)
- `resolution_policy` (deterministic rule for outcome selection)
- `outcomes` (see below)

**Constraints:**
- Every move must have at least:
  - `success`
  - `fail_forward` (**required**)
- `partial_success` is strongly recommended for richer gameplay.

---

### 2.4 Outcome (fail-forward execution)
**Purpose:** make every input “count”. Preconditions do not block execution; they **select a different outcome**.

**Fields (conceptual):**
- `result`: `success | partial | fail_forward`
- `effects`: deterministic deltas (state updates, relation shifts, flags)
- `next_scene_id`: may equal success target to reconverge
- `narration_slots`: structured beats for narration:
  - `npc_reaction`
  - `world_shift`
  - `clue_delta`
  - `cost_delta`
  - `next_hook`

**Constraints:**
- **No refusal**: unmet conditions → `fail_forward`, not “locked/invalid”.
- **Fail-forward must still progress**:
  - advance `beat_progress/scene_progress`, or
  - trigger required event tags, or
  - create a meaningful state change + move to a resolving scene.

---

## 3. Global Moves (Gameplay Backbone)

Each scene must include 2–3 global moves. Minimum set:
- `global.clarify`: low-confidence input → NPC asks/forces clarification **while advancing tension/progress**
- `global.look`: observation/scan → reveals a clue or changes situation slightly
- `global.help_me_progress`: “I don’t know what to do” → offers concrete next options + small progress

**Rule:** global moves remain available choices and button fallback targets, but text-routing failures in strict mode failfast.

---

## 4. Runtime Pipeline (Two-Pass)

### Pass A — Intent Routing
Input → `MoveInvocation`
- Button input: directly creates `MoveInvocation(move_id, args={})`.
- Free-text input: LLM (or heuristic) outputs structured JSON:
  - `move_id`
  - `args` (optional)
  - `confidence`
  - `interpreted_intent` (one sentence)

**Low confidence policy:**
- `openai`: if confidence < threshold, parse fails, or move is invalid, failfast this step with `503`.

### Pass B — Outcome Resolution (Deterministic)
`MoveInvocation + scene + state` → choose an `Outcome`
- Evaluate preconditions (if any) **only to select outcome**, not to reject.
- If unmet: choose `fail_forward`.
- Otherwise: choose `success` or `partial` according to `resolution_policy`.
- Apply `effects`, update progress, transition to `next_scene_id`.

### Narration (LLM or template)
Narration renders `narration_slots` into player-facing text using a strict template:
- **Echo**: restate interpreted intent (paraphrase)
- **Commit**: state the consequence (NPC reaction + cost)
- **Hook**: present the next actionable direction

**Safety:** narration must not leak internal fields/ids/markers; enforce a denylist + final guard. In strict providers, narration errors failfast instead of template fallback.

---

## 5. Pacing Rules (8–12 minutes)

### Defaults
- **14–16 steps** to reach an ending.
- Per step target reading time: ~25–40 seconds (short text, concrete options).

### Story authoring invariants
- Each step produces at least one player-visible change:
  - state delta (time/heat/resource), or
  - relation change (NPC trust/affection), or
  - progress/event tag, or
  - scene transition.
- Branch depth ≤ 2 scenes before reconvergence.

---

## 6. API Surface (v3 recommendation)

### Stories
- `POST /stories` — create draft with raw `pack_json`
- `POST /stories/{story_id}/publish` — publish a version (store raw `pack_json`)
- `GET /stories/{story_id}?version=...` — returns wrapper with `pack` = raw `pack_json`

### Sessions
- `POST /sessions` — create session bound to `{story_id, version}`, initialize `state`, set `current_scene_id`
- `GET /sessions/{session_id}` — fetch current status (optionally `dev_mode` for full state)

### Step (player action)
- `POST /sessions/{session_id}/step`
  - Request:
    - `client_action_id` (idempotency)
    - `input`: `{type:"button"|"text", move_id?, text?}`
    - `dev_mode?`
  - Response (minimum):
    - `scene_id`, `narration_text`
    - `recognized`: `{interpreted_intent, move_id, confidence}`
    - `resolution`: `{result, costs_summary, consequences_summary}`
    - `ui`: `{moves:[{move_id,label,risk_hint?}], input_hint}`
    - `debug` (dev only): resolution trace, applied deltas, selected outcome id

**Step contract:** `POST /sessions/{session_id}/step` may return `503` on LLM failures (route error, low confidence, invalid move, narration failure).

### Admin Diagnostics (no-auth in current phase)
- `GET /admin/sessions/{session_id}/timeline` — structured replay events (`step_started|step_succeeded|step_failed|step_replayed`)
- `POST /admin/sessions/{session_id}/feedback` — attach `good|bad` verdict and tags/notes to a session
- `GET /admin/sessions/{session_id}/feedback` — list feedback markers for a session

### One-click generation (author tooling)
- `POST /stories/generate`
  - Request: `{prompt_text?, seed_text?, target_minutes, npc_count, style?, publish?}`
  - Output: `{story_id, version?, pack, lint_report, generation_attempts, regenerate_count}`

---

## 7. Linter & Regenerate

### Linter checks
- Schema validity
- Reference validity: `next_scene_id`, `move_id`, `outcome_id` exist
- Every move has `fail_forward`
- Every scene includes required global moves (2–3)
- Reachability: entry → all required scenes reachable
- Existence of at least one ending path within 14–16 steps
- Basic cycle risk: ensure there is a terminating route
- Text leak guard: denylist scan on narration seeds (ids, debug markers)

### Regenerate loop (strict mode)
- Build pack and run linter.
- If linter fails, regenerate the full pack with derived seed.
- Max retries: 3 regenerates (4 total attempts).
- Prompt mode regenerates by rerunning `PromptCompiler + build + lint`.
- No local post-generation mutation of generated pack.

---

## 8. One-click Generation Pipeline (recommended)

1. **Prompt/Seed → Beat Plan**  
2. **Beat Plan → Scenes graph** (14–16 scenes, reconverging)
3. **Scenes → Moves/Intents** (3–5 visible + 2–3 global per scene)
4. **Outcomes fill** (success/partial/fail_forward; deterministic policies)
5. **Lint + Regenerate** (up to 3 retries)
6. **Publish + Playtest** (simulate one run; export transcript)

---

## 9. Observability & Testing

### Runtime telemetry (minimum)
- Route result: `move_id`, confidence, fallback/global routing
- Resolution result: success/partial/fail_forward, applied deltas
- Progress: beat/scene progress increments
- Session timeline events persisted for replay and diagnostics
- User-side quality markers (`good|bad`) linked to session and turn index
- Acceptance metrics:
  - meaningful_accept_rate (state/progress changed)
  - fallback_with_progress_rate

### Canary tests (must remain green)
- Healthy-path provider behavior: valid text/button inputs produce 200 and advance or change state (except inactive session)
- LLM route/narration failures produce 503 with structured error detail
- Preconditions unmet → `fail_forward` outcome
- Sample story completes within 14–16 steps

## 10. Notes on Extensibility

Move templates do not limit the game if treated as **interfaces**:
- Add story-specific moves for unique mechanics (e.g., `hack_terminal`, `cross_examine`)
- Keep global moves small and stable
- Prefer parameterization over move explosion to maintain routing accuracy
