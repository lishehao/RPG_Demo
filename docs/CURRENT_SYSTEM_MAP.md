# Current System Map

Read this as the source-evidence companion to the README, GitHub Pages demo,
and `#/portfolio` case-study surface. It answers three reviewer questions:
what path is current, what code backs it, and which older experiments are
provenance rather than the demo being claimed.

This repository contains multiple generations of the RPG demo. The current
portfolio-facing product path is intentionally narrow:

## Active User Flows

| Flow | Entry | Backend path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reviewer demo | `#/portfolio` -> `#/reviewer` | `POST /narrative/templates` then `#/play/:id?reviewer=1` | Curated English seed, real session, inspector enabled. |
| Create story | `#/create` | `POST /narrative/templates` | Requires real session because it spends LLM budget and writes a template. |
| Play shared story | `#/template/:template_id` | `POST /narrative/templates/:id/sessions` | Anonymous play is allowed; forking a template does not call the LLM. |
| Advance turn | `#/play/:session_id` | `POST /narrative/sessions/:id/story/turns` | LLM quota guarded per IP and per user/default actor. |
| Advisor chat | Play sidebar | `POST /narrative/sessions/:id/advisor` | Side-channel reads context but does not mutate story state. |
| Share replay | `#/replay/:session_id` | `GET /narrative/sessions/:id/replay` | Public read-only replay includes `template_id` so viewers can fork the same story. |

## Legacy Or Experimental Surfaces

| Path | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `frontend/` | Older frontend retained for historical reference. Current builds and deployment use `frontend2/`. |
| `rpg_backend/author/` | Legacy author-job flow for the older published-story library. Public deployments can disable it with `APP_PUBLIC_DEMO_AUTHORING_ENABLED=false`. |
| `rpg_backend/play/` | Older published-story play runtime. Still covered by tests, but not the current portfolio path. |
| `rpg_backend/author_v2/`, `rpg_backend/author_v3/`, `rpg_backend/play_v2/` | Iteration layers used to develop mechanics, compilers, and evaluation ideas. |
| `specs/`, `stitch_handoff/`, `project/` | Design notes and handoff artifacts. Useful for provenance, not required to run or review the demo. |

## Current Test Gate

The default release gate is deterministic and does not spend LLM tokens:

```bash
python3 tools/narrative_release_gate.py --mode fake
python3 -m pytest -q
```

`tools/narrative_release_gate.py` exercises the current core directly:
template creation, public fork, four-turn playthrough, advisor side-chat,
ending synthesis, highlights, branches, public replay, and ending
distribution. When a real endpoint is configured, `tools/http_product_smoke.py`
runs the equivalent live HTTP path through `/narrative/*`.

## Production Boundary

The public demo is deliberately demo-grade:

- Username-only auth is used for portfolio friction, not account security.
- Anonymous visitors can browse public content, start/fork play sessions, and view replay links.
- Write paths require a real session: story/template creation, publishing, visibility changes, deletes, and `/me/*`.
- LLM calls are guarded by `APP_PUBLIC_DEMO_DAILY_IP_LLM_LIMIT` and `APP_PUBLIC_DEMO_DAILY_USER_LLM_LIMIT`; forwarded client IP headers are only trusted from `APP_TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS`.
- Benchmark diagnostics remain disabled unless `APP_ENABLE_BENCHMARK_API=1`.
- SQLite is supported for the single-process deployment described in `deploy/aws_ubuntu/DEPLOY.md`; multi-instance production would need shared locks and centralized counters.
